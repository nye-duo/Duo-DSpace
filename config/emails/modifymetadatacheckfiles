Subject: DSpace - StudentWeb item has been reinstated
The item:

{0}

Has been reinstated into the archive, because the metadata was updated to a "pass" grade.

When items are reinstated, their files are not restored from the DUO_ADMIN bundle to the ORIGINAL
bundle - this must be done manually.  Once you have restored the files as needed, you should ensure
that the policy patterns applied are correct by running the curation task on the item.
